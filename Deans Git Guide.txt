Dean's Git Guide

NOTE: You must use command line for this guide. It's simple and powerful.
*For commands with explanations see bottom of guide.



GETTING STARTED

- Go to github.com and sign up for an account

- Then go to either windows.github.com OR mac.github.com and install the relevant Git Application for your OS

- BEFORE YOU CONTINUE POST YOUR USERNAME INTO THE FB GROUP SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU ACCESS TO THE REPOSITORY.
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO UPLOAD OTHERWISE!!

- Once you have installed the application. Use the terminal to navigate to the directory where you want to have your clone of the repository.

- Make sure you are where you want to be..

	EXECUTE COMMAND: git clone https://github.com/DCooksey/GroupProject.git
	
- This should download the repository to your computer

- Now you should have a GroupProject folder created in that directory if not something has probably gone wrong somewhere... ASK FOR SUPPORT 

- Once the folder has been created you can move or save any file into it.




UPLOADING TO THE REPOSITORY

- Once the chosen file has been saved or successfully moved into the GroupProject folder. Open up your terminal AND cd into the GroupProject folder (GIT WONT WORK OTHERWISE)..

	EXECUTE COMMAND: git add FILENAME.filetype
	!!Don't Write FILENAME change it to what your file is called!!

	EXECUTE COMMAND: git status
	
	EXECUTE COMMAND: git commit -m "MESSAGE"
	!!Between the quotations is where you add your message about what your changing or adding. Please be clear and specific. "Updated file" doesn't help anyone!!
	
	EXECUTE COMMAND: git push
	
- You will probably be prompted for your github user and password
	
- And you're done with uploading a file! 





DOWNLOADING CHANGES AND ADDITIONS MADE BY OTHER USERS TO THE REPOSITORY

!!ALWAYS DO THIS AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY USE OF THE GROUPPROJECT FOLDER!!

- Navigate to the GroupProject folder on your computer via the terminal.

	EXECUTE COMMAND: git pull
	
- And that's it. You may be notified of changes made and such.
