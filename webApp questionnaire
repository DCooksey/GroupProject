2. Would you like to be able to post a question anonymously? If not why?


3. Would you want to be able to gain access to an archived list of all questions and answers others have posted?


4. Would you like to be able to rate other users questions? If yes would you like the higher rated questions to appear nearer the top of the question feed?


5. Would you like the ability to choose the best answer to the question you asked or would you prefer other users to choose the answer? Or both.


6. Would you prefer having the option of attaching images to questions?


7. Would you like to have a profile picture/having a profile seems something important and necessary to you? (e.g. Profile listing all the questions you have posted so far, or the comments you have posted on questions)


8. Would you prefer to have a notification system that would send push notifications to you whenever someone comments/reply to the questions you have posted?



Please list these questions from 1 to 8. 1 being the most important feature to you and 8 being the least.
