This is a brief description of how to use this webapp [GoldHub].

Firstly, please change the screen size of your browser to "320/480" for optimum visual representation of this webapp.
Once you have done that use this URL 'http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~ma202dc/GroupProject/index.php' to load the webapp.

Secondly, to access the login page click on the 'MENU' button on the top left corner which gives you four options and the very first one is for logging in. Use the username - 'ma202dc@gold.ac.uk' and password: 'test' to login yourself in the webapp. After you are logged in, the webapp will greet you using the username[ma202dc etc] and let you ask a question with the option of categorizing it as well as letting you help your friends by answering to one of the existing questions.

There is a 'HOME' button on the top right that takes you to the HomePage right away from any other page whenever you click on it.
And the other button 'MENU' on top left, by clicking over it, lets the menu to hover down and gives you four options 
[which are not active yet]

If you click on the button 'Help your friends' it takes you to another page where all the existing questions posted earlier are listed and lets your answer to these questions or rate them.

We still need to write scripts for the panel buttons in the 'MENU' section; also for the 'SETTINGS" button which is at the bottom of the page in middle. Clicking on the 'SETTINGS' button does take you to another page though, letting you choose between two options of allowing the notification sound & push notification.

Furthermore, we are still in the process of writing the script for 'View post'
